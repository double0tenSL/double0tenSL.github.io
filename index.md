### Welcome to Lin Shi's Personal Pages.
In this page I will introduce what I learned in the class of secure software design.

### All projects
1. [Markov Sentence Generator](http://markov.double0ten.us/).
2. [Polynomial](http://poly.double0ten.us/).
3. [Minesweeper](http://minesweeper.double0ten.us/).
4. [Gee-mail -- in C++](http://geemail.double0ten.us/).
   <br>[Gee-mail -- in JAVA](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1i5nxPbR).

### What I learned from this semester
To be honest, I am very pleasant to take this class. Though in the beginning, I had a real trouble in the class because the reason of language. After worked hard in the whole semester, I gradually feel better in this class and get a lot of things in it.
<br>The first thing is how to operate and manage github and cloud 9. Many command like g++, gcc and other nips are mentioned in the class, I never heard that before. After the class, I can manage these guys as I think. The bash command will show the whole world for me.
<br>The second thing is I deeply understand the meaning of address, memory, pointer, stack, heap, STL. These words appear many times in the first stage of studying, we use these to understand the operating method of memory, and how can we use the thing saved in special address.
<br>The third thing is using GDB to diagnose the vulnerable and error code, which can bypass the safety precautions of the operating system.
<br>Next is skillful to use random generation.
<br>The last thing is database programming based on sqlite3 and the design of website using github, encryption method. Especially in the last project -gee_mail- I learned to encrypt and decrypt using SHA256 sala20 etc. and use sqlite3 connecting C++. This project might be a little difficult for me. Although my partners and I didn't finished it in C++. We also learned much from that. I know more about encryption, which is very important to be a security programmer.

### How to apply what I learned to reality
We shoulder the responsibility to make the world better. As a programmer, we not only need to make the whole world more automation and simple, but also should keep the security of the internet. Nowadays, with the development of information time, cyber security had increasingly attracted public attention. With the help of the class, I know how to encrypt massage in code, protecting massage from being attacked by hackers, I also know how to judge the error and vulnerable code. So, I could make the thing together and completed the last project -- gee_mail. The encryption could use in the every field around our world like the government, the bank and so many information. I believe these things will increasingly important and I will keep going with it.
